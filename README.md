# Raspberry-Pi-Buzzer-Music-Scripts
This is a collection of various Arduino buzzer music scripts I've found online which I then converted to run on a Raspberry Pi.

The scripts are setup to utilize two buzzers simultaniously, using pins 17 and 25.

Credits due are found in the first couple lines of each script.
